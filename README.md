# Data-Transformation-and-Aggregation
Data Transformation and Aggregation using Amazon Glue, implemented in PySpark
Step 1: Set Up AWS Account and Resources:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console or create a new AWS account if you don't have one.
Create an S3 bucket to store your source data, transformed data, and any intermediate outputs.
Step 2: Prepare Source Data:

Gather the desired data to transform and aggregate. For this example, let's assume you have a CSV file named "sales_data.csv".
Upload the "sales_data.csv" file to your S3 bucket.
Step 3: Create an Amazon Glue Data Catalog:

In the AWS Glue Console, create a new database named "sales_db" in the Data Catalog.
Step 4: Create an ETL Job in Amazon Glue:

Create a new ETL job in the AWS Glue Console.
Select your source (S3) and target (S3) data sources.
Specify the source table ("sales_data") in the Data Catalog and the target location for your transformed data ("s3://your-bucket/transformed-data/").
Choose "Script file" as the transformation type and "Python" as the script language.
Step 5: Transform and Aggregate Data using the PySpark script.

Step 6: Run and Monitor the ETL Job:

Run the ETL job in the AWS Glue Console.
Monitor the job's progress and logs to ensure it completes successfully.
Step 7: Verify the Transformed Data:

After the ETL job completes, check the target location ("s3://your-bucket/transformed-data/") to verify that the transformed data has been loaded.
Step 8: Data Quality and Testing:

Perform data quality checks on the transformed data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Use sample queries to test the aggregated results and verify that the transformation logic is correct.
Step 9: Automate and Schedule:

If needed, set up a schedule for the ETL job to run at regular intervals using Amazon Glue's scheduling capabilities.
Configure notifications or alerts to monitor the job's status and get notified of any issues.
Step 10: Visualize and Analyze Data:

Use tools like Amazon QuickSight or your preferred data visualization tool to connect to the transformed data and create visualizations.
Analyze the aggregated data and derive insights based on your business requirements.
Please note that this example is simplified for illustration purposes and may need adjustments based on your specific data and requirements. Be sure to customize the code to match your data source, transformation logic, and target storage.
